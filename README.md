# movie-box-office-game

movie-box-office-game is a web-based higher-lower game with movie box offices.

## How to play?

The player is presented with two movies. One of the movies will display its box office and the other will not. The objective of the game is to guess if the other movie's box office is higher or lower than the first one.

If the player answers correctly, the other movie's box office will be revealed. The first movie is then removed and another hidden movie is brought in for a new round.

This repeats until the player answers incorrectly which leads to the game ending. The player is rewarded with one point for every round they lasted.

## Installation

TBD

## Contributing

Eventually I'll be looking for contributions in form of data entry for movies that wish to be added to the game.
